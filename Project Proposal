TITLE : Image processing on FPGA using Verilog HDL


B) OBJECTIVES 

To learn how to represent an image as a matrix.
To learn how to manipulate and analyze an image using code.
To learn the basics of FPGA and use it to do some basic operations on an image.

C) It would be implemented as RTL project.

D) FUNCTIONALITY
	
We would be implementing various functions to process the image.

Invert image: This function will invert an image.

Black and white : This function will convert any image into a black and white image.

Increase/decrease brightness of an image.

Threshold Operation

Image smoothening.(Tentative)


We would display our project via a website(Tentative).
